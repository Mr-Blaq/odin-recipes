  <h2>Classic hot wings with a sweet and spicy kick. Serve with ranch or extra crumble bleu cheese dressing.</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>    
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup bread flour</li>
    <li>½ cup brown sugar and butter flavored breakfast cereal (such as Cap'n Crunch®), finely ground</li>
    <li>5 pounds large chicken wings, patted dry with paper towels</li>
    <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>¾ cup hot pepper sauce </li>
    <li>¼ cup bourbon whiskey</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon habanero pepper sauce</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Whisk together eggs and milk in a bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the bread flour and ground cereal. Coat the wings in the egg mixture, then in the cereal mixture.</li>
    <li>Fry the wings, 6 at a time, in the oil until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let wings drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Line several baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>While wings are frying, mix the melted butter, hot sauce, bourbon, honey, Worcestershire sauce, and habanero sauce in a large plastic tub with a lid. Place the wings into the sauce, close the lid, and shake to coat wings with sauce.</li>
    <li>Place the wings on the prepared baking sheets and bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is slightly sticky, about 10 minutes.</li>
